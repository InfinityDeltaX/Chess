Chess Engine written in entirely in Java.

Implements UCI protocol, as seen here: http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html

Can be used with a front-end such as Arena 3.5: http://www.playwitharena.com/

As an alternative, the game can be played at the command line (without a GUI) by typing 'text' as the first command when the program starts.
